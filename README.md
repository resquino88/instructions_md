# How to Run Python Scripts on a Windows Machine

### Description:

Python is one of many programming languages (Java, C++, Lua, R, etc) and is the most commonly used due to its simplicity and widespread use across fields such as Computer Science, Data Science, and Engineering. It is considered a scripting language, which means it is used when a redundant task needs to be done. Many scientists and engineers make use of its various libraries (prewritten code) aid in research and/or meet client/customer needs.

### Prerequisites:
